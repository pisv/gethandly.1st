Get a handle on Handly. Step One
================================

This is a minimal but complete example of a Handly-based model
with a two-level hierarchy of elements (FooModel containing FooProjects)
and some resource delta processing for keeping the model up-to-date.
It demonstrates the basic structuring and behavior of a Handly-based model.

See the [Step One](https://github.com/pisv/gethandly/wiki/Step-One)
of the article [Get a handle on Handly](https://github.com/pisv/gethandly/wiki)
for a comprehensive guide to the making of this example.
